# R
I learned some basic R programming through the course 'the R Programming Environment' on Coursera. 
Here are some solutions I have written for Project Euler puzzles. I made these to do some independent programming next to the course. 

I also finished the Coursera quiz, which focuses on the data science usage of R.
